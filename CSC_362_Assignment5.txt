CSC 362 Programming Assignments #5
Due Date: Friday, November 15


These two assignments require that you implement two Intel assembly language programs
embedded in C programs. If you are using Windows, you will have to use Visual Studio. If you
are using a Mac, you will have to use Xcode. Otherwise, you will have to log in to the NKU 
virtual lab to access a virtual Windows 10 computer running Visual Studio. 



Program 5:    Implement the Selection Sort algorithm for an array of int values in assembly
language. The selection sort makes n-1 passes through an array of n elements locating the
smallest element and swapping it with the ith element. For instance, on the first pass, i=0, locate
the smallest element in the range of j=0 to j=n-1 and swap it with array[0]. On the second pass,
i=1, locate the smallest element in the range from j=1 to n-1 and swap it with array[1]. The
algorithm is shown below.

                for(i=0;i<n-1;i++) {
	    min = a[i];
	    minposition = i;

	        for(j=i+1;j<n;j++) {
	            if(a[j] < a[minposition]) {
		min = a[j];
		minposition = j;
	            }
	        }
	        swap a[i] and a[minposition]
	}



Implement your code in assembly language with the array declared and initialized in C code
(hardcode the array to its values rather than inputting the array for convenience), and after the
assembly code output the sorted array in C code. Note that you may find this program tricky
because you are limited to 4 data registers. Use only one array (do not manipulate a copy of the
array). Run the program on the 2 data sets below.

Run #1: 100, 99, 97, 95, 90, 87, 86, 83, 81, 77, 74, 69, 63, 50, 44, 43, 39, 31, 29, 12
Run #2: 8, -1, 7, -8, 6, 3, -4, 4, 1, -2, 9, -5, 0, 2 



For both programs, submit the source code and output. In both cases, the output can be added to
your source code in comments at the bottom. Make sure your code is well-commented, as
discussed in class.
